The `Java Odoo XML-RPC` project provides tooling and abstraction for interactions with your Odoo XML-RPC API.\
First, it provides the [java-odoo-xml-rpc-core](java-odoo-xml-rpc-core/README.MD) library which provides you some tooling for the serialization of objects returned by Odoo.\
Second, it provides you the [java-odoo-xml-rpc-plugin](java-odoo-xml-rpc-plugin/README.MD) which will help you for the generation of Java classes corresponding to Odoo Models.
